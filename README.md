# Tic Tac Toe Project

This project is meant to test my ablity to write factory and modular functions, as well as practice having as little global variables as possible and using private variables instead. This was also my first time using the minimax algorithm, which I used to make the unbeatable bot player.

Just start clicking away to play. Names are optional. X starts first, then the loser starts after that. You can also go against a bot, which depending on the difficulty you choose will either be a normal difficulty or just plain unbeatable.

P.S. This project is a part of The Odin Project's course.
